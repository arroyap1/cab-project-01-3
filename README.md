## Problem Statement
We have been tasked with finding a more cost effective and
environmentally friendly way for TCNJâ€™s fleet to operate. To address the issue of the economical and enviromental composition of TCNJ's vehicle fleet, the vehicles should
undergo a transition from ICE vehicles to zero vehicles utilizing a First In First Out method. This will allow vehicles to be operated to their full potiential without having an immediate monetary cost, and ensure there are no labor constraints due to the transition. 

## Objective
Objective: Address the TCNJ vehicle fleet composition in an effective approach for reducing emmissions and reducing cost. Create a database that holds and operates the data
for TCNJ's vehicle fleet such as fuel source, emmissons, service life, and depreciations.

## Description of the Database
Database will consist of an interactive user interface that allows both a user and adminstrator to input and retrieve information regarding TCNJ's vehicle fleet. The input for the database will contain boolean expressions in coordinance with each categorical search. There will be ten attributes of information regarding the vehicle composition with boolean expressions for the user to pick what information they are looking for. The database highlights difference characteristics per vehicle and can also be updated
annually by the adminstrator. 

We hope that our final database will help us solve the problem of creating a more
cost effective and eco-friendly fleet for TCNJ. Our database should highlight different
characteristics per vehicle for the proposal/future years. It should also specify what
vehicles will be the most cost efficient and environment safe options. The following
elements will be major variables and output data needed to help solve the problem: fleet
fuel source and emissions, fleet quantity and age, and fleet operational costs. By
examining the variables and outputs, we will be able to properly determine which
vehicles need to be replaced, hopefully in accordance with FIFO.

## Description of the need for module
The module is necessary in addressing the problem because it provides
information about how fuel source, emissions, age, quantity, and operational costs
influences our solution. By examining the variables and outputs, we will be able to properly determine which
vehicles need to be replaced, hopefully in accordance with FIFO.
