## 2. Problem Statement

For our project, we have been tasked with finding a more cost effective and
environmentally friendly way for TCNJ’s fleet to operate. In order to become more cost
effective and better for the environment, we suggest slowly transitioning from ICE
vehicles to zero vehicles. By doing so over time, no large budget will need to be
immediately created. Instead, money shall be allocated per year for the entire
transitioning period. This transition period may last 20+ years. Our plan to achieve this
involves using the FIFO method to retire the model older cars first and replace those
with the zero vehicles. This will allow newer vehicles to continue in operation, and keep
replacement costs as low as possible. As new vehicles are introduced, we will use the
straight line method of depreciation. This will keep depreciation costs low and constant
over the lifespan of the vehicles.


## Objective

Our overall objective is to create a solution that will address how TCNJ can be
more efficient in reducing emissions and simultaneously create a plan that will be cost
effective for the school. Our specific objective for the module is to provide a database
that holds data regarding TCNJ’s vehicle fleet such as fleet fuel source and emissions
and fleet service life and depreciation. The database will include a user interface that
allows the user to input a year and retrieve information regarding TCNJ’s vehicle fleet

## Description of the desired end product/ the part you will develop for this class.

We hope that our final database will help us solve the problem of creating a more
cost effective and eco-friendly fleet for TCNJ. Our database should highlight different
characteristics per vehicle for the proposal/future years. It should also specify what
vehicles will be the most cost efficient and environment safe options. The following
elements will be major variables and output data needed to help solve the problem: fleet
fuel source and emissions, fleet quantity and age, and fleet operational costs. By
examining the variables and outputs, we will be able to properly determine which
vehicles need to be replaced, hopefully in accordance with FIFO.

## Description of the importance/ need for the module/how it addresses the problem.

The module is necessary in addressing the problem because it provides
information about how fuel source, emissions, age, quantity, and operational costs
influences our solution. The module will also highlight the future plans for the vehicles
and add a description to the proposed vehicles being put into place. Through our
database, we will be able to illustrate how our plan for a slow integration of the new fleet
will be the most beneficial to both TCNJ and the broader community. The database will
be able to show how using a FIFO method of inventory management will be a
necessary process in order to replace older vehicles first, as older cars emit more
emissions than more modernized vehicles. Additionally, it will highlight how straight-line
depreciation will be most beneficial through a possible depreciation schedule.
